# GroMet

GroMet, or Growth Metrics, is a system designed to help you take better care of your plants.
It does this by tracking the soil humidity, temperature, and light exposure of any
given plant, and transferring that data to a central hub, which looks for discrepancies
between the care requirements of a plant and the care that it is currently receiving.

When prompted, the hub will give a short report, or To-Do list, letting you know how much
and what kind of care each of your plants requires, so that you can be sure that they
are each cared for in the best manner possible.
